## About This Repo

This repo is created for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It include:
*Run_Analysis.R, the script file that completes the requirement;
*Code_Book.md, describes the data, variables and works that have been done;
*Output.txt, the output generated from Run_Analysis.R, the cleaned data set;
*README.md, this file.

## Run_Analysis.R

The script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
